<p>A massive search operation involving the Indian Air Force and the Army is under way to locate the AN-32 transport aircraft that went missing with 13 people onboard just 35 minutes after taking off from Jorhat in Assam on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>The IAF and the army have pooled their resources to keep two planes &ndash; a C-130 and AN-32 aircraft &ndash; and two choppers in the air to try locating the missing aircraft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some ground reports were received on possible location of a crash site. Helicopters were routed to the location, however, no wreckage has been sighted so far,&rdquo; the Indian Air Force said. The statement rebuts reports that the plane had crashed and the wreckage had been found.</p>
<p>A total of eight aircrew and five passengers were onboard the aircraft, the IAF said in a statement.</p>
<p>An IAF spokesperson also underlined that the search operation was a combined effort. &ldquo;IAF is coordinating with Indian Army as well as various government and civil agencies to locate the missing aircraft,&rdquo; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The IAF said the search operations from air and by ground parties of Indian Army are planned to continue through the night.</p>
<p>The aircraft was flying to Mechuka Advanced Landing Ground, a landing strip that had been renovated just a few years ago in the eastern Himalayas of Arunachal Pradesh&rsquo;s West Siang district.</p>
<p>The landing strip is about 30-odd km from the nearest point on the India-China border.</p>

<p>The AN-32 took off from Jorhat in Assam at 12.27 pm and last contacted ground agencies at 1 pm. &ldquo;Thereafter, there was no contact with the aircraft,&rdquo; the IAF said.</p>
<p>When the aircraft did not reach the destination, overdue actions were initiated by Indian Air Force.</p>
<p>The Russian-origin AN-32s joined the IAF in 1983. The IAF has more than 100 AN-32s in its fleet.</p>
<p>Monday&rsquo;s missing aircraft revived memories of the AN-32 that went missing while flying from Chennai to Port Blair in July 2016. A massive search mission was then launched to find the 29 people on the transport plane. The IAF had carried out 200 search sorties to cover over 2 lakh square nautical miles multiple times by these aircraft but successful. The 29 people &ndash; most of them passengers &ndash; were then presumed dead.</p>
